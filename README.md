# Climate-Data-Analysis

•Developed a data science project analyzing climate change using the NorESM2 model and ClimateBench dataset,
employing Python and libraries like Pandas and Numpy

• Built and evaluated a linear regression model to predict global warming based on CO2 emissions, extending the
analysis to regional temperature variations by country.

• Created a user-friendly command-line interface for model interaction, enabling prediction of temperature changes
from user-inputted CO2 levels and regions.

• Visualized data and regression outcomes to elucidate the relationship between CO2 emissions and temperature
changes, enhancing understanding of climate impact.

This Notebook was part of the final project of my course DSC 200: Data Science Programming under Professor Duncan Wattson-Paris.
The Markdown cells provide clear explanations for each and every step of the project.
